## What is Codex?

Codex is a new kind of editor for developers, based on [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm). Note that Codex uses a subset of GFM.

## Is Codex open source?

You may be surprised to learn that Codex is MIT open source. Why? Building an editor is _hard_ and the more companies build products based on hard-to-learn technologies in the general domain, the better for the world.
