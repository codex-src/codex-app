# Codex is a new markdown editor for devs 👩‍💻👨‍💻

_**Note:** that this the alpha of the Codex editor — some features are not yet implemented such as links, lists, and images._

Codex is based on CommonMark so you can format your notes using special syntax characters called _markdown_.

You can format _italic_, **bold**, `code`, and ~strikethrough~. We also support the alternate syntax for *italic*, __bold__, and ~~strikethrough~~.

As you type, **your note is automatically saved to localStorage,** so you can refresh the page or reopen the page and your note persists. 🎉
