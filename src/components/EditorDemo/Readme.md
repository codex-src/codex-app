## The Codex editor makes it easier than ever to express yourself in words _and_ `code` ðŸŽ‰

_Codex_ is a new editor for the web, based on CommonMark. _Format_ your notes using **special characters**. And when you paste in and out of the Codex editor, you never loose formatting.

**Your edits are saved to localStorage.** Refresh the page or reopen the browser and your note should persist. Donâ€™t forget you can copy your note if you need to.
