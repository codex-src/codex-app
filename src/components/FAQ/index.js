						What is Codex?
						<Answer>
							Codex is a new WYSIWYG, what-you-see-is-what-you-get, markdown editor and notebook, based on web technologies.&nbsp;<span aria-label="atom symbol" role="img">‚öõÔ∏è</span><br />
							<br />
							<strong>Codex enables you to work more productively by helping you focus on what matters ‚Äî your writing.</strong>

					<QuestionBlock>
						Why is it called /Ààk≈çÀådeks/?
						<Answer>
							The name ‚ÄòCodex‚Äô is primarily inspired by <a className="text-blue-500" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Leicester" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leonardo da Vinci‚Äôs Codex Leicester</a>. His codex was one of many for documenting his discoveries. I actually found out when writing this that <a className="text-blue-500" href="https://businessinsider.com/look-inside-the-codex-leicester-which-bill-gates-bought-for-30-million-2015-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Gates bought Codex Leicester at auction for $30 million dollars in 1994</a>.&nbsp;<span aria-label="exploding head" role="img">ü§Ø</span><br />
							<br />
							About a year ago, I got really inspired by this idea of ‚Äòwhat would a modern, technical journal look like?‚Äô and ‚Äòwhy don‚Äôt we have more sophisticated tools for knowledge-sharing over the Internet?‚Äô This led me to building Codex.

						Does Codex support GitHub Flavored Markdown?
						<Answer>
							Yes! The Codex parser is based on <a className="text-blue-500" href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>. There are <em>few</em> changes where the parser was designed to emphasize WYSIWYG editing, but for all intents and purposes, Codex is GFM-compatible.<br />
							<br />
							Codex supports:<br />

					<QuestionBlock>
						What if I don‚Äôt like markdown syntax?
						<Answer>
							The decision to render markdown was intentional to make authoring <em>and maintaining</em> markdown easier over time.<br />
							<br />
							That being said, I‚Äôve taken great efforts to minimize the impact of markdown; some elements are rendered purely as WYSIWYG (like lists and section breaks), and all markdown syntax can be hidden in ‚ÄòPreview Mode‚Äô, which also locks the document from editing.

					<QuestionBlock>
						Does Codex support embedding media and tables?
						<Answer>
							Not yet, but these are planned features. Not only do I want to provide these kinds of rich elements for you, but I want them myself!

					<QuestionBlock>
						Does Codex support collaborative features like Google Docs or Figma?
						<Answer>
							Not yet. Everything you see has been designed and engineered by one person ‚Äî that‚Äôs me, hello!&nbsp;<span aria-label="waving hand" role="img">üëã</span> ‚Äî and I simply haven‚Äôt figured out how to engineer collaborative features‚Ä¶yet.<br />
							<br />

					<QuestionBlock>
						Who is Codex designed for?
						<Answer>
							Ultimately, Codex is designed for <em>anyone</em> who wants to author written content on the web more easily. Specifically, Codex is being developed for the developer community.&nbsp;<span aria-label="hugging face" role="img">ü§ó</span><br />
							<br />
							In the future, I‚Äôd like to make the editor more useful in order to support the greater technical community. I plan on adding support for LaTeX elements and more.

					<QuestionBlock>
						Why are you making Codex?
						<Answer>
							The original plan was to self-publish programming courses on the Internet ‚Äî I love programming, and I want to share my love of programming with the world. However, I immediately noticed just how inconvenient authoring even written content on the web is. So instead of making courses, I decided to try to solve the bigger problem.<br />
							<br />
							Editors are <em>hard</em>, and web-based editors are the stuff of nightmares.&nbsp;<span aria-label="face screaming in fear" role="img">üò±</span> This is why you see so few good ones. But anything hard is worth doing, so I‚Äôm committed to building Codex for myself and others.
						</Answer>
					</QuestionBlock>

					<QuestionBlock>
						How does the Codex editor actually work?
						<Answer>
							You might be surprised to learn that the Codex editor (and pretty much all the technology Codex uses) is <a className="text-blue-500" href="https://github.com/codex-src" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT-licensed open source</a>. It‚Äôs important to me that everything I‚Äôve learned <em>be learnable</em>.<br />
							<br />
							Back to the question: essentially, I use React and <code className="px-1 py-px font-mono -text-px text-md-blue-a400 border rounded">contenteditable</code> to seed control of user-editing to a virtual representation of the document. <code className="px-1 py-px font-mono -text-px text-md-blue-a400 border rounded">input</code> events, among other events, manipulate the virtual document. React then re-renders the virtual document <em>back</em> to the screen, diffing changes a long the way.<br />
							<br />
							Of course, the implementation is far more subtle and <em>treacherous</em>.&nbsp;<span aria-label="ghost" role="img">üëª</span> If you are personally interested in contributing to the Codex editor, <a className="text-blue-500" href="https://twitter.com/username_ZAYDEK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">send me a DM so I can onboard</a>.<br />
							<br />
							(No ‚Äî I‚Äôm not using a popular open source library like <a className="text-blue-500" href="https://github.com/facebook/draft-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Draft.js</a> or <a className="text-blue-500" href="https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodeMirror</a> to engineer Codex. This was an intentional decision to make sure I could learn <em>how</em> editors work and own the editor experience I‚Äôm building.)

						Can I use Codex for my personal blog?

					<QuestionBlock>
						Why should I pay for Codex?
						<Answer>
							You don‚Äôt have to. The free tier offers unlimited documents, each capped at 2k words.<br />
							<br />
							For reference, 2k words is <em>a lot</em> ‚Äî a 400-page book is on the order of 100k words, so 2k words gets you 1/50th of a book, for free!<br />
							<br />
							However, when you pay for Codex, you get <em>a lot</em> more:<br />
							<br />
							<ul>
								<li>
									<input className="form-checkbox mr-4 text-green-400 rounded-full shadow" type="checkbox" defaultChecked tabIndex="-1" />
									<span aria-label="books" role="img">üìö</span> Unlimited documents (included in the free tier)

									<span aria-label="rocket" role="img">üöÄ</span> Export documents to HTML
								</li>
							</ul>
							<br />
							Codex is designed to be inexpensive, the same as one <em>damn good</em> Green Tea Latte per month.&nbsp;<span aria-label="teacup without handle" role="img">üçµ</span> <strong>By paying for Codex, you make Codex sustainable.</strong>

					<QuestionBlock>
						Why do you offer a self-service discount?
						<Answer>
							If you need a discount, <Link to={paths.pricing} className="text-blue-500">simply toggle the ‚ÄòI need a discount‚Äô checkbox on the pricing page</Link>. This discount exists to support users who need it.<br />
							<br />
							Codex as a service is already designed to be inexpensive, but when you apply the self-service discount, you take up to 20% off.<br />
							<br />
							Please don‚Äôt apply the discount if you don‚Äôt need it.&nbsp;<span aria-label="face with raised eyebrow" role="img">ü§®</span>
