						What is Codex?
						<Answer>

						Why is it called \c≈ç¬∑dex\?
						<Answer>
							The name ‚ÄòCodex‚Äô is primarily inspired by Leonardo da Vinci‚Äôs Codex Leicester. His codex was one of many for documenting discoveries. I actually found out when writing this that <a className="text-blue-500" href="https://businessinsider.com/look-inside-the-codex-leicester-which-bill-gates-bought-for-30-million-2015-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Gates bought Leonardo da Vinci‚Äôs Codex Leicester at auction for $30 million dollars in 1994</a>.&nbsp;<span ariaLabel="exploding head" role="img">ü§Ø</span><br />
							<br />
							About a year ago, I got really inspired by this idea of ‚Äòwhat would a modern, technical journal look like?‚Äô and ‚Äòwhy don‚Äôt we have more sophisticated tools for knowledge-sharing over the Internet?‚Äô This led me to building Codex.

						Does Codex support GitHub Flavored Markdown?
						<Answer>
							Yes! The Codex parser is based on <a className="text-blue-500" href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Flavored Markdown</a>. There are <em>few</em> changes where the parser was designed to emphasize WYSIWYG editing, but for all intents and purposes, Codex is GFM-compatible.

						What if I don‚Äôt like markdown syntax?
						<Answer>
							The decision to render markdown was intentional to make authoring <em>and maintaining</em> markdown easier over time.<br />
							<br />
							That being said, I‚Äôve taken great efforts to minimize the impact of markdown; some elements are rendered purely as WYSWYG (like lists and section breaks), and all markdown syntax can be hidden in ‚ÄòPreview Mode‚Äô, which also locks the document from editing.

						Does Codex support collaborative features like Google Docs or Figma?
						<Answer>
							Not yet. Everything you see has been designed and engineered by one person ‚Äî that‚Äôs me, hello! <span ariaLabel="waving hand" role="img">üëã</span> ‚Äî and I simply haven‚Äôt figured out how to engineer collaborative features.<br />
							<br />

					<QuestionBlock>
						Who is Codex designed for?
						<Answer>
							Ultimately, Codex is designed for _anyone_ who wants to author typed content on the web more easily. Specifically, Codex is being developed for the developer community.<br />
							<br />
							In the future, I‚Äôd like to make the editor more useful in order to support the wider technical community. I plan on adding support for LaTeX elements and more.

					<QuestionBlock>
						Why are you making Codex?
						<Answer>
							The original plan was to self-publish programming courses on the Internet ‚Äî I love programming, and I want to share my love of programming with the world. However, I immediately noticed just how inconvenient authoring on the web is. So instead of making courses, I decided to try to solve the bigger problem.<br />
							<br />
							{/* TODO: Small caps? */}
							TL;DR: Editors are <em>hard</em>, and web-based editors are a nightmare. <span ariaLabel="face screaming in fear" role="img">üò±</span> This is why you see so few <em>good ones</em>. But anything hard is worth doing, so I‚Äôm committed to building Codex for myself and others.

					<QuestionBlock>
						How does the Codex editor actually work?
						<Answer>
							You might be surprised to learn that the Codex editor (and pretty much all the technology Codex uses) <a className="text-blue-500" href="https://github.com/codex-src" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is actually MIT-licensed open source</a>. It‚Äôs important to me that everything I‚Äôve learned <em>be learnable</em>.<br />
							<br />
							Back to the question: essentially, I use React and <code>contenteditable</code> to seed control of user-editing to a virtual representation of the document. <code>input</code> events, among other events, manipulate the virtual document. React then re-renders the virtual document <em>back</em> to the screen, diffing changes a long the way.<br />
							<br />
							Of course, the implementation is far more subtle and <em>treacherous</em>. <span ariaLabel="ghost" role="img">üëª</span> If you are personally interested in contributing to the Codex editor, <a className="text-blue-500" href="https://twitter.com/username_ZAYDEK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">send me a DM so I can onboard you the various repos Codex uses</a>.<br />
							<br />
							(No ‚Äî I am not using a popular open source library like <a className="text-blue-500" href="https://github.com/facebook/draft-js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Draft.js</a> or <a className="text-blue-500" href="https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodeMirror</a> to engineer Codex. This was an intentional decision to make sure I could learn <em>how</em> editors work and own the editor experience I am building.)

					<QuestionBlock>
						Why should I pay for Codex?
						<Answer>
							<em>You don‚Äôt have to.</em> The free tier offers <em>unlimited documents</em>. Please note these documents are limited to 2,000 words.<br />
							<br />
							{/* TODO: Underline? */}
							For reference, 2,000 words is <em>a lot</em> ‚Äî a 400-page book is on the order of 100,000 words, so 2,000 words gets you 1/50th of a book, for free!<br />
							<br />
							However, when you pay for Codex, you get <em>a lot</em> more:<br />
							<ul>
								<li>
									<input type="checkbox" checked />
									<span ariaLabel="books" role="img">üìö</span> Unlimited documents (included free)
								</li>
								<li>
									<input type="checkbox" checked />
									<span ariaLabel="open book" role="img">üìñ</span> Unlimited document-length

									<span ariaLabel="alien monster" role="img">üëæ</span> Monospace-mode

					<QuestionBlock>
						Why do you offer a self-service discount?
						<Answer>
							If you need a discount, <a href="TODO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simply toggle the ‚ÄòI need a discount‚Äô checkbox on the checkout page</a>. This discount exists to support users who need it.<br />
							<br />
							Codex as a service is already designed to be inexpensive, but when you apply the self-service discount, you take up to 20% off.<br />
							<br />
							Please don‚Äôt apply the discount if you don‚Äôt need it. <span ariaLabel="face with raised eyebrow" role="img">ü§®</span>

					<QuestionBlock>
						Do you offer refunds?
						<Answer>
							Yes. If you‚Äôre not satisfied with Codex, send an email to me at <a href="todo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refunds@getcodex.dev</a>. No questions asked.<br />
							<br />
							Please note that refunds are <em>not</em> prorated. <strong>If you didn‚Äôt enjoy your experience with Codex, I‚Äôll refund you 100% of your original purchase</strong>, regardless of how long you actually used Codex for. I do this because I mean it when I say I want you to enjoy your stay.<br />
							<br />
							That being said, if you have ideas for how to improve Codex, I graciously ask you share your feedback <em>instead</em> so I can do everything we can to serve you better. <a href="https://twitter.com/username_ZAYDEK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simply DM me with your feedback.</a> I‚Äôm making Codex to make our collective lives easier, so your feedback potentially helps other people, too. Don‚Äôt hesitate to share your honest and open feedback!<br />
