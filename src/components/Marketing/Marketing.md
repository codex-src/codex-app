# Imagine a markdown editor, built for the modern web

There comes a time in every developer‚Äôs career when you feel the sudden urge to build a blog. Not just any blog ‚Äî no, **your blog**‚Ä¶the best blog there ever was.

And it will be magnificent!

It will support everything from _italics_, **bold**, `code`, and ~strikethrough~. Even emoji, dammit!

üî•üî•üî•

Why stop there?!

What about blockquotes?

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
>
> ‚Ä¶whatever the hell that means

Done.

What about code blocks?

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

Done!

// Why stop there? Why not support comments **only you can see**? üëª

For then, and only then, would you rule.

So, how would you build it? **You don‚Äôt have to.** Just use Codex.

**Codex is a new platform for authors to write _and format_ their every thought in plain ‚Äòol markdown. Notes are automatically backed up to the cloud.**

Codex works in all modern browser, even on mobile.

We hope you love it. ‚ù§Ô∏è
