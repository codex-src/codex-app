# Readme

_**Note:** This the alpha of the Codex editor â€” some features are not yet implemented such as links, lists, and images._

Codex is based on CommonMark so you can format your notes using special syntax characters called _markdown_.

You can format _italic_, **bold**, `code`, and ~strikethrough~. We also support the alternate syntax for *italic*, __bold__, and ~~strikethrough~~.

Also, **your note is synchronized to localStorage after every write,** so you can refresh the page or reopen the browser and your note will persist. ðŸŽ‰
